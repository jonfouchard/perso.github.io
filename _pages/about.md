I'm a CNRS research fellow, biophysicist working in the department of Developmental Biology of the [IBPS](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) Institute at Sorbonne Universit√©, and a member of the group [Co-development of muscle and associated connective tissue](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/Recherche/umr-developpement-adaptation-et-vieillissement/formation-reparation-muscles-tendons). 

During development and at adult age, cells and tissues are subjected to stretches, compressions or changes of the rigidity of their surroundings. In order to adapt to such dynamic mechanical environment, they often change shape or mechanical properties. My research is focused on those mechanisms of adaptation that emerge from soft matter and active matter principles.
For that, I develop mechanical setups providing measurements at the cell and/or tissue scales coupled to live imaging. 

Currently, I work mainly on the dynamics of the extra-cellular matrix in the context of soft tissue mechanics, a topic which has implications for development, physiology of adult organs and tumorigenesis. However, I'm still interested in some of my past research topics, like single cell mechanosensing and epithelial tissue mechanics. I'm also curious about the evolution of scientific language, currently working on the [names and representations associated to living tissues](https://nomduntissu.hypotheses.org/).
